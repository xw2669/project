Description:
In this project, we point out the location of squirrels in Central Park on an OpenStreets map, and we also create a table to show all the squirrelsâ€™ information, for instance, latitude, longitude, unique squirrel ID, behaviors including running, chasing, climbing and so on. In this table we can click the link to see some statistics data: the minimum data among longitude, latitude and date, and the number of different types of age and primary fur color. We also have the link to add or delete some squirrel data. Moreover, if we click on the link on the unique squirrel ID, we can see the detail information of a squirrel and update some information.
